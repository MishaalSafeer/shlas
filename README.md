This project is for a Smart Home Loads Automation System.
The Application lets the users control their electricity switches and view their status real-time.
A machine learning algorithm helps identify user's activity pattern and presents a schedule to the user within the App.
If the user agrees with the presented schedule, the App automatically controls the home switches and turns them ON/OFF.
The application also shows electricity consumption and estimated bill calculated from the consumed units.
